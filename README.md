Hello, world!

This is from oniontest2. But commit shows it's from oniontest1... Be careful.

`user.name` setting is more important than `user.email`.

`user.email` should be matched with the account's email address.

Edit from oniontest1:

I'd suggest practicing git using multiple accounts. Use different browser and use local user.name, user.email. Then add SSH Host info to `~/.ssh/config`

This repo is created by oniontest2.
